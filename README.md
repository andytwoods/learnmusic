## üîß Usage

### Setting Up Users

- **Normal User Account**: Go to Sign Up and fill out the form. Once submitted, you'll see a "Verify Your E-mail Address" page. Check your console for a simulated email verification message, copy the link into your browser, and your email will be verified.

- **Superuser Account**: Create an admin user with the following command:
  ```bash
  python manage.py createsuperuser
  ```

For convenience, you can keep your normal user logged in on Chrome and your superuser logged in on Firefox (or similar), so that you can see how the site behaves for both kinds of users.

### Development Commands

- **Run the server**:
  ```bash
  python manage.py runserver
  ```

- **Type checks with mypy**:
  ```bash
  mypy learnmusic
  ```

## üß™ Testing

### Python Tests

To run the tests, check your test coverage, and generate an HTML coverage report:

```bash
coverage run -m pytest
coverage html
```

Then open `htmlcov/index.html` in your browser to view the coverage report.

You can also run tests with Django's test runner:

```bash
python manage.py test
```

### JavaScript Tests

The project includes comprehensive tests for JavaScript files, particularly for `learning_manager.js`.

#### Manual Testing in Browser

A dedicated test page has been set up to test JavaScript functionality in the browser:

1. Start the Django development server:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

2. Navigate to the test page:
   ```
   http://localhost:8000/notes/test-js/
   ```

#### Automated Testing with Jest

Jest tests have been set up for thorough testing of JavaScript functions:

1. Install Node.js dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Run the tests:
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

For more details about JavaScript testing, see the [JavaScript tests README](learnmusic/static/js/tests/README.md).
